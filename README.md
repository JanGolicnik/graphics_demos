# Graphics demos

A collection of some of the graphics programming things I've made.
 
### Shadowmapping

Self explanitory, render from lights perspective and sample to get occlusions. Very naive implementation with lots of artifacts

### Ship

Some ship physics and infinite ocean, very basic

### Mountain

Not done

### Datamoshing

Cool post processing effect using motion vectors where you move existing pixels on the screen according to motions, sorta like how video compression works. Would look better on a more complex scene.

### Animations

Simple skeleton animations from gltf files. Vertices store up to 4 joints and their weights and then just read their matrices from a buffer updated from the cpu.
